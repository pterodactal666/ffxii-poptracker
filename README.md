# AP support

This is a quick & dirty WIP fork of [jeeves833's FFXII PopTracker pack](https://github.com/jeeves833/ffxii-poptracker), which aims to add Archipelago autotracker support.
This version of the tracker is built for version 0.4.0 of the Archipelago world.

Autotracking works for most locations.  You still need to manually mark when you get characters/guests, when you defeat bosses, and most "Chests" checks.  It's a work in progress.

## Before Using

Make sure to adjust the Settings tab (next to Characters) to match your settings. This will allow you to enable/disable locations like hunts and clan rewards if you are not shuffling them.

Note that the number of chests on each screen is random, so chest locations have been grouped together by logical accessibility.
